About This Project
This interactive page was developed as a personal initiative to offer a more engaging and dynamic alternative to the traditional resume format.

It was built from the ground up to showcase not just my professional experience, but also my practical skills in product planning, user experience (UX) design, and a keen eye for modern aesthetics and usability.

From the initial concept to the final line of code, this entire project was executed independently. It serves as a testament to my ability to take an idea from scratch and turn it into a polished, functional, and user-centric product.
